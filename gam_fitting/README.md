# neuroGAM
This is a MATLAB package to fit generalised additive models (GAM) to neural data. If your primary goal is to fit a generalised linear model (GLM), consider using dedicated packages available elsewhere (e.g. [this](https://github.com/pillowlab/neuroGLM) or [that](https://github.com/pillowlab/GLMspiketools)).
